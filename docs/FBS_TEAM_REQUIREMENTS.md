# FBS Team: Critical Design Requirements

## 🚨 **URGENT: FBS Must Be Implemented as Embeddable Framework**

**Note: While this document uses rental management as an example for clarity, the embeddable pattern applies to ANY business solution** (retail stores, manufacturing systems, healthcare platforms, financial services, education platforms, e-commerce, logistics, etc.). The rental system is used purely for illustration - the same architecture and integration patterns work universally across all business domains.

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

**FBS cannot be a standalone microservice.** It must be designed as an **embeddable business framework** that integrates directly into applications, similar to how Django apps work.

**Current Problem:** FBS is being built as a separate HTTP service
**Required Solution:** FBS must be importable and callable directly within applications

---

## 📋 **Key Requirements**

### **1. Framework-Agnostic Design**
FBS must provide business logic that can be imported into any Python framework:

```python
# Django usage (current requirement)
from fbs.business.tenants import TenantManager

def create_tenant_view(request):
    manager = TenantManager()
    result = manager.create_tenant(request.POST)  # Direct call
    return JsonResponse(result)

# FastAPI usage (new requirement)
from fbs.business.tenants import AsyncTenantManager

@router.post("/tenants/")
async def create_tenant(tenant_data: TenantCreate):
    manager = AsyncTenantManager()
    result = await manager.create_tenant(tenant_data.model_dump())  # Direct async call
    return result
```

### **2. Direct Method Calls (No HTTP)**
❌ **Wrong Approach:**
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - HTTP calls between components
response = requests.post("http://fbs-service:8000/api/tenants", json=data)
```

✅ **Correct Approach:**
```python
# DO THIS - Direct method calls
from fbs.business.tenants import TenantManager
manager = TenantManager()
result = await manager.create_tenant(data)  # Direct call
```

### **3. Orchestrator Pattern**
FBS should provide an orchestrator that manages business operations:

```python
from fbs.core.orchestrator import FBSOrchestrator

# Initialize for specific solution
fbs = FBSOrchestrator(solution_name="rental_management")

# Get business modules
tenant_manager = fbs.get_tenant_manager()
payment_processor = fbs.get_payment_processor()
bi_engine = fbs.get_bi_engine()

# Use directly
result = await tenant_manager.create_tenant(data)
```

---

## 🏗️ **Required Architecture**

### **FBS Package Structure**
```
fbs/
├── core/
│   ├── orchestrator.py          # FBSOrchestrator class
│   ├── config.py               # Configuration management
│   └── database.py             # Database abstraction
├── business/
│   ├── tenants.py              # TenantManager class
│   ├── payments.py             # PaymentProcessor class
│   ├── rooms.py                # RoomManager class
│   └── bi.py                   # BIEngine class
├── integrations/
│   ├── odoo.py                 # Odoo client
│   └── email.py                # Email service
└── frameworks/
    ├── django/                 # Django helpers
    └── fastapi/                # FastAPI helpers
```

### **Business Module Interface**
```python
class TenantManager:
    async def create_tenant(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Business logic here - no HTTP calls
        pass

    async def get_tenant(self, tenant_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Direct database/cache access
        pass

class PaymentProcessor:
    async def process_payment(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Payment processing logic
        pass
```

---

## 🔄 **Migration Requirements**

### **From Microservice to Embeddable**

1. **Extract Business Logic**: Move all business logic from HTTP endpoints to library classes
2. **Remove HTTP Layer**: Eliminate internal HTTP calls between FBS components
3. **Create Orchestrator**: Build FBSOrchestrator as main integration point
4. **Direct Database Access**: Allow FBS to access application databases directly
5. **Async Support**: Ensure all methods support async/await for FastAPI compatibility

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Keep HTTP API as optional for existing integrations
- Allow both embedded and microservice usage patterns
- Provide migration path for existing users

---

## ✅ **Why This Architecture Matters**

### **Performance Benefits**
- **3x Faster**: Direct method calls vs HTTP requests
- **Lower Latency**: No network overhead
- **Better Resource Usage**: Single process architecture

### **Developer Experience**
- **Type Safety**: Python objects vs JSON serialization
- **Better Debugging**: Single process debugging
- **IDE Support**: Full autocomplete and refactoring
- **Testing**: Direct unit testing of business logic

### **Operational Benefits**
- **Simpler Deployment**: Single application deployment
- **Easier Monitoring**: Single process monitoring
- **Consistent Architecture**: Unified business logic layer

---

## 🚨 **Critical Implementation Notes**

### **Must Support:**
1. **Async/Await**: All FBS methods must be async for FastAPI compatibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: FBS should work with framework DI containers
3. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration for different environments
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
5. **Transactions**: Database transaction management
6. **Caching**: Built-in caching for performance

### **Must NOT Have:**
1. **Internal HTTP Calls**: No requests between FBS components
2. **Framework Lock-in**: Should work with Django, FastAPI, Flask, etc.
3. **Hard Dependencies**: Optional dependencies for integrations
4. **Singleton Patterns**: Allow multiple FBS instances for different solutions

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Required**

1. **Stop Microservice Development**: Halt development of FBS as HTTP service
2. **Review Current Architecture**: Assess what can be salvaged from current approach
3. **Design Embeddable Interfaces**: Create interface contracts for all business modules
4. **Implement Core Orchestrator**: Build FBSOrchestrator as main integration point
5. **Create Framework Adapters**: Build Django and FastAPI integration helpers
6. **Test Integration Patterns**: Validate with real applications

## 📞 **Questions for FBS Team**

1. **Timeline**: How long to pivot to embeddable architecture?
2. **Resources**: What additional resources needed for this approach?
3. **Migration**: How to handle existing microservice users?
4. **Priorities**: Which frameworks to support first (Django, FastAPI, Flask)?
5. **Dependencies**: Which external integrations are critical vs optional?

---

## 🎊 **Bottom Line**

**FBS must be an embeddable business framework, not a microservice.** This is critical for performance, developer experience, and operational efficiency.

**The current microservice approach will not work for our integration requirements.** We need direct method calls, not HTTP APIs.

**Please confirm you understand these requirements and can implement FBS as an embeddable framework.**
