## 🔧 **Critical Fixes**

### **1. DMS User Attribution Fix** 🛠️ **CRITICAL**
- **Issue:** DMS views assumed `request.user.company_id` exists, causing AttributeError in production
- **Impact:** Prevented DMS module from functioning in standard Django environments
- **Solution:** Implemented safe attribute access using `getattr(request.user, 'company_id', 'default')`
- **Files Fixed:**
  - `fbs_dms/views/document_views.py`
  - `fbs_dms/views/file_views.py`
  - `fbs_dms/views/search_views.py`
  - `fbs_dms/views/workflow_views.py`

### **2. AuthService Constructor Robustness** 🔐
- **Issue:** AuthService required solution_name parameter but views called it without parameters
- **Impact:** TypeError when accessing authentication endpoints
- **Solution:** Made solution_name parameter optional with 'default' fallback
- **File Fixed:** `fbs_app/services/auth_service.py`

### **3. Logging Standardization** 📊
- **Issue:** Inconsistent logger naming across services (mix of 'fbs_app' and '__name__')
- **Impact:** Fragmented logging configuration and harder troubleshooting
- **Solution:** Standardized all loggers to use 'fbs_app' for consistency
- **Files Updated:**
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_workflow_service.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_accounting_service.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_business_service.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_compliance_service.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_analytics_service.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/msme_service_manager.py`
  - `fbs_app/services/odoo_client.py`
  - `fbs_app/models/core.py`

### **4. Variable Reference Fix** 🐛
- **Issue:** Undefined variable reference in auth service logging
- **Impact:** NameError during handshake creation
- **Solution:** Fixed variable reference to use `self.solution_name`
- **File Fixed:** `fbs_app/services/auth_service.py`
